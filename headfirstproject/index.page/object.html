    <h1>This Land Is Your Land</h1>
    <p>by Woody Guthrie</p>
    <p>This land is your land This land is my land<br>From California to the New York island;<br>From the red wood forest to the Gulf Stream waters<br>This land was made for you and Me.</p>
    <p>As I was walking that ribbon of highway,<br>I saw above me that endless skyway;<br>I saw below me that golden valley:<br>This land was made for you and me.</p>
    <p>I've roamed and rambled and I followed my footsteps<br>To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts;<br>And all around me a voice was sounding:<br>This land was made for you and me.<br>Nobody living can ever stop me,<br>As I go walking that freedom highway;<br>Nobody living can ever make me turn back<br>This land was made for you and me.</p>
