    <h1>Inline Elements</h1>
    <p>Inline elements are used to markup text inside a block element like a paragraph or division.Each element dose different things to the text.<strong>This text is in a strong element. This text is in a bold (b) element.</strong>Bold and strong seem to have the same effect. <em>This is emphasised (em) text. It seem to look the same as this<i>italicized text here.</i></em></p>
    <p>Putting text inside quote elements,"like this quoted text here"make the text display with quotation marks around it. Code(code) tags are meant for source code examples. They look like <code>code text here.</code>The keyboard element (kbd) looks the same, <kbd>keyboad test here,</kbd>but meant for example of user entered data.</p>
    <p>Superscript and subscript elements do what they say.<sup>this is superscript</sup>and<sub>this is subscript.</sub></p>
    <p>Span elements don't seem to do anything at all. I've put about every other inside span tags. can you tell which is which? </p>
